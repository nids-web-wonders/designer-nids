                        behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

                        The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial position for the
                        background image ie., it is used to set an image at a certain position. The position that is
                        relative to the positioning layer, can be set by using the background-origin property.

                    <p>
                        It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in
                        CSS,
                        and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
                        Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.
