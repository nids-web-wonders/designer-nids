                        Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are
                        very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s
                        responsible for setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device.
                        Containers are defined within the container class (.container). In other words, we can say that
                        containers are established the width for the layout to give the content. Elements and content
                        are added within the container.

                        Grid systems are aids designers use to build designs, arrange information and make consistent
                        user experiences. They include rule of thirds, golden section, single-column, multi-column,
                        modular, baseline and responsive grid systems. For example, responsive adapts content to screen
                        size and orientation, for consistency.
